cd maof-framework
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª Basic Usage

### Simple Example

```python
from maof_framework import Orchestrator, Task, AgentConfig, OpenAIAgent

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = Orchestrator()

# Configure and register an agent
config = AgentConfig(
    agent_id="gpt4-1",
    name="GPT-4",
    provider="OpenAI",
    agent_type=AgentType.LLM,
    endpoint="https://api.openai.com/v1",
    api_key="your-api-key",
    capabilities=["text", "code", "analysis"]
)

orchestrator.register_agent(OpenAIAgent(config))

# Create and process a task
task = Task(
    task_id="001",
    task_type="text",
    content="Analyze this text for sentiment"
)

result = await orchestrator.process_task(task)
print(f"Result: {result.result}")
```

### Advanced Workflow

```python
# Process multiple tasks in parallel
tasks = [task1, task2, task3]
results = await orchestrator.process_workflow(tasks, parallel=True)

# Aggregate results
aggregator = ResultAggregator()
consensus = aggregator.aggregate(results, strategy='consensus')
```

## üéØ Best Practices Summary

### DO's ‚úÖ
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Maintain context across interactions
- Use async/await for parallel execution
- Implement circuit breakers
- Track costs and set budgets

### DON'Ts ‚ùå
- Don't hardcode API keys
- Don't ignore rate limits
- Don't send entire history to every agent
- Don't make synchronous calls for independent tasks
- Don't expose internal details to users
